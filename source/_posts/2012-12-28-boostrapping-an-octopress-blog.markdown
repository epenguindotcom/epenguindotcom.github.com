After much foot-dragging, I finally sat down and created this blog using Octopress and GitHub Pages.  The whole process is
rather smooth thanks to well written official [document][1] as well as other how-to's on the internet.

For starter, the generated static pages will be deployed to my free account on GitHub.  There are other options, such as
the famed Heroku service, however.  For now, I just took an easy route.  I may try to have the static pages deployed on my
own VPS through the rsync method in the future.

To start a basic Octopress based blog, one needs to:

    1. Installing proper ruby and gem environment;
    2. Cloning the Octopress repo;
    3. Configuring the blog meta info;
    4. Creating blog posts; and
    5. Deploying the blog data.

This post serves the validation test that all the above procedures are **properly** executed.
